This is my first Kaggle submission.
It is my first basic submission which is based on Random Forest approach. It classifiers the people taking loan as defaulter or not.

I ended up getting a score of 0.69642 for the RandomForest model.
Which would have got me a rank of 6234 if I would have participated in the contest.

Another model based on Logistic Regression was also developed and gave a score of 0.68107 .
